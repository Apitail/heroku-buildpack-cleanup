# Heroku Buildpack: Clean after deploy

## Delete the node_modules directories

The maximum allowed Heroku slug size (after compression) is 300MB. Image-heavy apps can somethings butt up against this limit, especially when using multiple buildpacks. If you're using Node.js to compile your front-end assets, but not to run your app, you may be able to save a large amount of space by deleting the `node_modules` directory before slug compilation.

## Usage

```bash
$ heroku buildpacks:set [https://github.com/leoafarias/heroku-buildpack-node-modules-cleanup](https://github.com/Apitail/heroku-buildpack-cleanup)
```
